# Project One

Project One is a vertically scrolling **boss-only shoot'em up** with colorful and distinct graphics.

The game was frozen for nearly a year and is now again under development. Currently important code parts are migrated to the new engine, this may take some time. Recent screenshots can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3Vt7NBil4aCTnctanI4M1dPQU0).
