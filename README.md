# Project One

Project One is a vertically scrolling **boss-only shoot'em up** with colorful and distinct graphics.

The game was frozen for nearly a year and is again under development. Currently important code parts are migrated to the new engine, this may take some time.

More information will be available this summer.
You can download the old version [from Game Jolt][1].
