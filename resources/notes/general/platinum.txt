You need "unique selling points" -- as in Bayonetta, it's Witch Time, the game's slowed-down time mode. A pro designer should be able to come up with three good ideas, Inaba said.
- Player movement (4 directions, slow during shooting)

Then there are features which expand the game, such as character unlocks. "It opens things up in a very lateral way."
- Weapons and Supports

Then there's depth: "It's not easy to give an example. A combo system is one," Inaba said. These are gameplay systems that require mastery to engage with fully.
- Scoring (combo, badges, chroma (enemies))

"Core gamers aren't the only ones who play action games so it's necessary to make sure players of different levels can enjoy your game," Inaba cautioned. "It's important to widen the entry point of your game, but you also have to make sure that those who play straight through the path enjoy the experience." Depth, he said, is equally important.
- accessibility

"What is the replay value in action games? It's really about improving the player's skills. I'm not talking about unlocking skills in game, but actually improving his or her skills," he said.

But even with that in mind, always remember the players who will only play the game one time on the basic difficulty level: "it's important for those players to have the best experience," too, he said.
- no intrusive difficulty selection

"We create situations where we take those players to levels beyond their own expectations," Inaba said. "Therefore we need stages or gimmicks, or combat situations made just for those opportunities. It's really a luxury for action games, they need to be fun and enjoyable even if you play it only once."

Platinum's games have distinct and memorable main characters -- none so much as Bayonetta. "The purer the action game, the higher the need for a really original and unique main character," said Inaba.
- TODO, story relevant

Here's the crucial takeaway: Constant excitement becomes numbing. Players will get tired if games continually ramp up. "Let's think about what to do to avoid that situation," he said. The good news is that if you carefully tune the intensity of the game at a high level, you will get a much more favorable result. 6-4-6-7 instead of 5-6-7-8
- TODO, correct reordering and polishing when all stages are finished
